## Python
Make sure Python is installed (you can install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
Simply run this command to execute a python file:
```bash
python3 01/a.py
```

## C / C++
I use a C library made by me for my C solutions, you can find it [here](https://github.com/itljan30/data-structures).
It implements some basic data structures like a dynamically sized array.

Run the following commands from the root directory to build all problems. 
The .exe files will be put in the same directory as the days source code.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Rust
Make sure Rust is installed, you can install it [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
Run the following command to run a specific problem from the root directory:
```bash
cargo run --bin day1_1
```
