## Building
All problems solved using C use a library that I have made that
implements some basic data structures in C.
Here is the github link for that if you are interested: https://github.com/itljan30/data-structures

Run the following commands from the root directory to build all problems. 
The .exe files will be put in the same directory as the days source code.
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```
